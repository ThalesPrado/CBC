What is a Conjoint Analysis? According to Harvard Business School Conjoint analysis is a form of statistical analysis that firms use in market research to understand how customers value different components or features of their product or service.

Type of Conjoint Analysis? The most common types of conjoint analysis include: Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) Analysis: This is one of the most common forms of conjoint analysis and is used to identify how a respondent values combinations of features.

Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA): This form of analysis customizes each respondent's survey experience based on their answers to early questions. It’s often leveraged in studies where several features or attributes are being evaluated to streamline the process and extract the most valuable insights from each respondent. Full-Profile Conjoint Analysis: This form of analysis presents the respondent with a series of full product descriptions and asks them to select the one they’d be most inclined to buy.

MaxDiff Conjoint Analysis: This form of analysis presents multiple options to the respondent, which they’re asked to organize on a scale of “best” to “worst” (or “most likely to buy” to “least likely to buy”). For this project/simulation I have used CBC due to the scenario that I am currently facing at work so this was the reason behind that.

What could be improved in this project?

The project does not have a sensitivity analysis as of today. That basically understand which features are the most relevant for a customer purchase.
